# Challenge

># React Coding Challenge
>The goal of this coding challenge is to give you an opportunity to showcase your knowledge and show us how you work on a real-life project.
We are intentionally not forcing you to use any particular library (other than React) so you don't have to learn something new just for a code challenge, but please take into account that even when we are not expecting a production ready app we do expect you to be able to explain why you picked those dependencies for the job.
Also, please be mindful about not adding features outside of the scope of this code challenge so you don't end up investing more time than it's needed.
>## Introduction
>Your local movie theater is in dire need of attracting new audience.
To do this, they're asking you to build a simple web application that allows users discover new movies and search for them.
Since they don't have a backend service, the first version of the application will be built using the public api https://developers.themoviedb.org/3
